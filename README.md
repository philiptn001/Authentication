# Authentication
Project to learn about authentication, both basic and token based.

## Project 1:
Project to learn on about Basic Authentication for the Books API
Steps:
* Add a python decoder for Basic Authentication. The authentication decoder must only authorize a user with the following credentials: username='admin', password='admin'
* Add the decorator on top of all of the resources' methods (get, post, put, delete methods)
* Send a get request to get the book with ID=206 and check if the authentication is working with valid username and password

## Project 2:
Project to learn on how to implement two methods to encode/decode credential information (username, password) to/from a json/string
Steps:
* Pick a quite long string (a private key) for encoding and decoding purposes.
* Create a method which accepts a parameter called "username". The method must create a json like {'username': 'admin', 'creation_time':XXXXX} then use the itsdangerous's json-web-signatures to encode it into a string with chosen private key
* Create another method which accepts a token generated by the previous step. it returns the username by decoding the token if it a valid token and if token is created no later than 10 seconds. Otherwise, it returns proper exceptions
* Create an encrypted token for the valid username and password
* Decode the token to print the username("admin")
* Wait for 10 seconds and try to decode the token again
* Create a random string and try to decode it

## Project 3:
Project to learn about Token-based Authentication
Steps:
* Create a new resource and implement an endpoint for authenticating and generating an authentication token based on the code written in the previous activity.
* Add a python decoder as we did in the first activity, but this time decode the given token (assumed to be present in request header) to see it is a valid token (decodable, and not expired)
* Add the decorator on top of all of the resources' methods (get, post, put, delete methods)
* Now you need to add authentication to the auto-generated swagger-doc
* Test the authentication method, by running the RESTful service
* Generate a token by invoking the endpoint generated in the first step
* Feed the generated token to the endpoints by clicking on the "Authorize" button and filling the input:
